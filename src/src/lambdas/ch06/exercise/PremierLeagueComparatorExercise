PremierLeague is a league where football clubs in England play against one another.
At the end of the season, the team with maximum points are crowned champions for that year.

In this exercise the input is a list of objects of the type PremierLeagueTeam.We have a list of 
PremierLeagueTeam objects that captures-
a. the total points accumulated
b. the total number of goals scored against other teams
c. total number of goals scored by other teams against them
d. The goal difference which is  :  goals scored - goals against.
Refer to the class PremierLeagueTeam in the package lambdas.ch06.exercise

Based on this input, the requirement is to get the team standings. The standings are based on the following-
1.The team with the most number of points stands first followed by 2nd largest and so on.
2.If 2 teams have the same number of points, we need to rank them using goal difference. The team with the higher goal difference appears/ranks higher. 
3.If 2 teams have same goal difference, then the team we rank them or sort them based on the goals scored by that team, the team that has scored more
goals ranks higher.

Based on this, we need to implement a Comparator in the :
1.Usual way - anonymous class or class which implements Comparator interface
2.Using methods in Comparator interface - comparing/comparingInt/reversed
3.Refactor the code to use method references.

Solution-
The solution can be found in the class PremierLeagueComparatorTest.
The getTeamStats() method in it returns some mock data.
