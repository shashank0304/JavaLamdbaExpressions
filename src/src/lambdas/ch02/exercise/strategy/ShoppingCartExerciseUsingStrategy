In this exercise, we are going to continue with the simulation of a payment process for a shopping cart.
Notice how the pay method in the earlier exercise needs to be modified as a new payment type is 
introduced into the system.

Is there a better way to implement this requirement ?

We will re-factor the code from the previous exercise and introduce the strategy pattern to handle the different payment
types.

Requirement-
The method that we need to implement is the pay method as shown below:

	public PaymentStatus pay(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy)
    
Depending on the payment type chosen, we are going to calculate the total amount of the items purchased in the cart.

In the output,we will display :
1.The total amount.
2.The status of the payment, the value will be one of the following:SUCCESS,FAIL,PENDING

Solution -
Can be found in the lambdas.ch02.exercise.strategy package. Notice the PaymentStrategy interface along
with the implementations: CashOnDeliveryPayment,CreditCardPayment,DebitCardPayment.
