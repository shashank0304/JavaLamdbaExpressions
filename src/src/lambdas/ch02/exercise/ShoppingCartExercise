In this exercise, we are going to simulate the payment process for a shopping cart.
Refer to the PaymentType class(in the lambdas.ch02.exercise package) which shows the 
different types of payment available in the system.

Requirement-
The method that we need to implement is the pay method as shown below:

    public PaymentStatus pay(PaymentType paymentType)
    
Depending on the payment type chosen, we are going to calculate the total amount to be paid for the items purchased.
Refer to the ShoppingCart class that contains a list of items.

In the output,we will display :
1.The total amount.
2.The status of the payment, the value will be one of the following:SUCCESS,FAIL,PENDING

The pay method needs to handle all the payment types. In a real world system, the steps required for each type
of payment will be more involved but we will keep it simple. The learning here is that the system can start with just 2
types of payment, and in that case, the implementation of the pay method will be simple. 
Once the system starts supporting additional types of payments, notice the changes that we need to make to the pay method.
2 types of payment have been commented out in the code, uncomment the same and handle these types in the pay method.

Solution -
Can be found in the lambdas.ch02.exercise package.Refer to the classes ShoppingCart,PaymentStatus,PaymentType,Item.
Run the ShoppingCartTest class
