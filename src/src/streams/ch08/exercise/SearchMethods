   We are going to read a file invalidpasswords.txt in this exercise. The file contains a few words that
   must not be used as a password. Assume that a user enters a password as a string. As part of password
   validation, we need to check that the password is not among these words in the file.
   Output - The output must be a true or a false.
   The solution is in ExerciseFourSolution.java
   
 5.Exercise five
   We are going to read a file sample.txt in this exercise. The file contains few lines. The file is 
   considered a valid file if every line starts with a "#" and ends with a "#". If one of the lines 
   does not contain this delimeter, then entire file is considered an invalid file. 
   Output - The output must be a true or a false.
   The solution is in ExerciseFiveSolution.java
   
 6.Exercise Six
   Understanding the behavior of takeWhile operation.Refer to the file TakeWhileListSet.java
   Take a look at the code, the source of the stream in the first half of the code 
   is a List and in the 2nd part it is a Set. In both cases, we are calling the takeWhile
   operation.Run this file a few times,take a look at the output.The code also contains
   a call to the peek function.This will help you to understand the behavior of takeWhile 
   along with the concept of ordering on the stream.
