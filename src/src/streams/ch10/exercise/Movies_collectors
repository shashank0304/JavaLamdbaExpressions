In this exercise, we are going to perform operations around a mock movie database.
The classes involved are 
1. Movie.java- Holds information about a movie
2. MovieUtil.java - Populates mock data
3. MovieTest.java - This will contain the different implementations
4. Genre - enum that contains different movie genres.

  Fetch the list of movies by their Genre.
  Hint - Group movies by genre
  Solution - Find the solution in MovieTest.java in the package  streams.ch10.exercise
  
2.Exercise two
  Find the number of movies released in each year
  Output - {2003=1, 2019=2, 2020=2, 2006=2, 1976=1, 1979=1, 2013=1, 1982=1, 1999=1}
  Solution - Find the solution in MovieTest.java in the package  streams.ch10.exercise

  Find the gross earning of movies classified by genre
  Output - {HORROR=50000000, SUPERHERO=3000000000, COMEDY=533000000, ACTION=1693099584, CRIME=683000000}
  Solution - Find the solution in MovieTest.java in the package  streams.ch10.exercise
  
  
4.Exercise four
  We would like to watch movies only with a rating of 4 and 5. Retrieve a list movies objects with a rating of 4 and 5.
  Hint - Group movies by rating.
