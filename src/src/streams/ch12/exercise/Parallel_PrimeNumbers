Exercise -
In this exercise, we are going to find the total number of parallel numbers starting from one
up to 10 million. Write the code using both sequential and parallel streams.

In section 3, we re-factored a lambda body that found first ten prime numbers.Use that as a reference, the name of java file
for the refactoring was ThreadLambdasMultipleStatement.java

Compare the time taken for execution in both cases - Use
Instant start = Instant.now();
Instant end = Instant.now();
and then Duration.between(start,end).toMillis().

Output
The total number of prime numbers should be  664579
