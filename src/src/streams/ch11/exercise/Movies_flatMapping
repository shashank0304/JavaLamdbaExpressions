In this exercise, we are going to perform operations around a mock movie database.
The classes involved are
1. Movie.java- Holds information about a movie
2. MovieUtil.java - Populates mock data
3. MovieTest.java - This will contain the different implementations
4. Genre - enum that contains different movie genres.

1.Exercise one
  Find list of stars who have acted in Martin Scorsese movies
  Output must be a List<String>
  
  
2.Exercise two
  Find unique list of stars who have acted in Martin Scorsese movies
  
3.Another example of flatMap
  I have a blog about flatMap here :
