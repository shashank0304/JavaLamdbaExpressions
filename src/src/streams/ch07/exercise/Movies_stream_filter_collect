In this exercise, we are going to perform operations around a mock movie database.
The classes involved are 
1. Movie.java- Holds information about a movie
2. MovieUtil.java - Populates mock data
3. MovieTest.java - This will contain the different implementations
4. Genre - enum that contains different movie genres.
These classes can be found in the package streams.ch07.exercise

1.Exercise one
  Open MovieTest.java , there is a method getFiteredMovies written using imperative style of coding.
  This method currently retrieves the list of movies released in the year 2020.
  Re-factor this code to contain declarative style of coding.
  The predicate is already defined.
  Make use of stream,filter and collect methods.
  
2.Exercise two
  Implement a method getActionMovieNames that retrieves the names of movies that belong to the Action genre
  The output will be a List<String> as we are only interested in the names of the movies.
  Output - [Casino Royale, Fight Club, Bad Boys For Life, Rocky Two, Rocky, Rocky Three]
  
3.Exercise three
  Retrieve a list of action movies sorted by name alphabetically
  Output - [Bad Boys For Life, Casino Royale, Fight Club, Rocky, Rocky Three, Rocky Two]
  
4.Exercise four
  Retrieve a list of action movies sorted by release date
  Output - [ Movie [name=Rocky, dateOfRelease=1976-12-03], 
             Movie [name=Rocky Two, dateOfRelease=1979-06-15], 
             Movie [name=Rocky Three, dateOfRelease=1982-05-28], 
             Movie [name=Fight Club, dateOfRelease=1999-10-10], 
             Movie [name=Casino Royale, dateOfRelease=2006-11-14], 
             Movie [name=Bad Boys For Life, dateOfRelease=2020-01-17]
            ]
  
5.Exercise five
